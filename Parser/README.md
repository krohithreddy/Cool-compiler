# COOL Compiler #
     TEST CASE 1:
			 In the first test  case everything is a correct code for sorting a list which will give any error 
			 it checks all of the grammer rules
	TEST CASE 2:
	        there is an error in line 24 where i remover a multiplication symbol which gives an objectid error
	TEST CASE 3:
	         it is same as 2nd one but now i removed a "r" insted of removing "*" so it gives an syntax error since it is not in any grammer form
	TEST CASE 4:
	         in line 136 "class Main" is written as "class main" so there it an error since after class it should be typeid
	         but main is objectid

grammer:
         all the rules are as per cool manual in the particular order
         since we are not doing phase B 
         i returned null from program

compile and execution in the same manner sir has given.
